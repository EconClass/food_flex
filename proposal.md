### Food Flex Proposal

Sharing a list of places you have eaten at has always been a trivial task for foodies. Often times, foodies will rely on their memory, notes, or view their check-in's on social media (yelp, facebook, swarm, etc). The issue with these platforms is that they are tricky to parse and filter through. Over time your memory will fail you and notes become difficult to keep track of. Check-in's document everytime a user visits a place by chronologically recording every time a user visit's and remembers to check in. The issue with check-in's is that they are rather limited due to the inability to filter and that they log every visit ever. The goal of Food Flex is to flex where you have been ; Think Pok√©mon badges, but instead of Gym's, restaurants. With the use of Yelp's API, Food Flex will allow users to document all "unique" restaurant visits and sort those restauarants by the many Yelp filters such as price, distance, or neighborhoods. The goal of Food Flex is to track/share the places you have eaten at and see where your friends have been.
