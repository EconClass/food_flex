# Food Flex: track where you eat

A platform that utilizes Yelp's API to see where you have eaten. Yelp Check-in's record every visite, but Food Flex gives users important stats such as: 
- Restaurants that you have eaten at in a certain location/radius
- Number of restaurants eaten at
- More coming soon
